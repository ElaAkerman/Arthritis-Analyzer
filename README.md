#### Analysis and reveals new insights of Arthritis as function of 90 different genes (in the y axis) and the subject (in the x axis).

## Description
This project allows you to see and analyse whether a particular subject has Arthritis (A common disorder that affects joints) or not. It also helps you revel which genes have an impact on the disease.
The project has different plots using various methods such as clustering and normalization. 
With the use of PCA method, you can scatter a plot of your samples (subjects) to see how many are healthy and sick.
I programmed with Python and used libraries as: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Numpy.
This project opened my curiosity to dive in the world of Data Science and use it for medical purposes such as reveling different diseases.

## How to use?
* Clone the project into your local enviroment: `git clone https://github.com/ElaAkerman/Arthritis-Analyzer.git`
